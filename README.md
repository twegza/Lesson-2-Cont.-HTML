# lesson2
This is lesson two with more features added to a small website!

In this lesson I learnt some cool HTML basics like:

1. Images: "<img src="#">", which helped me to put my logo at the beginning of the site.

2. Lists: (Ordered "<OL>" and Unordered "<UL>"), which helped me to build a basic nav bar.

3. Tables "<table>--><tr>--><td>": I used it to preview my data with a basic static view.

4. Forms "<form>--><input type=type>": I used it to build a basic contact form.
  
  
  These are the basics of HTML I just learnt!
